# Welcome to my portfolio repository!

This repository is the source code of the front-end part of my portfolio made with **NextJS** and **TypeScript**. There are a couple of improvements that I will make every month, but the basic version is online and accessible through [https://valentingrenier.fr](https://valentingrenier.fr).
